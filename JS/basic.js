//data types
//String => "ram" //sting are those within ""
//Number => 1,2,3 //number are those numbers without ""
//Boolean => true ,false //Boolean are true or false only

// 3 declarations in js
// var
// let
// const
const name = "Yedi";
const age = 19;
// const boolean1 = true
// const boolean2 = false
//console.log("My name is", name); this is how noobs do it
//template literal 
// and this is how pros do it using ${}
// also use ` instead of "" or '' cuz its just better 
console.log(`My name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`);
//number dont have length in javascript
const name2 = "Yedii";
console.log(name2.length)//this gives total length of the string
